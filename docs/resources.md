## 1. Exercises

Roughly easy → hard. Each builds on the code in this repo.

**Warm-up**
1. Run the MA crossover on every ticker in the dataset (`backtester.available_tickers()`). Which does it work best on? Worst?
2. Run the 5/20 crossover with 0 and 20 bps costs on QQQ. How much of the return do costs eat?
3. Plot the RSI of `TLT` and mark every day it went below 30.

**Build**
4. **Momentum strategy:** in `strategies/template.py`, hold when the price is higher than it was 120 days ago. Compare with the MA crossover.
5. **Stop-loss:** modify a strategy so it exits if the price falls 10% below the entry price.
6. **Combine signals:** only buy RSI dips when the 200-day trend is up (price above its 200-day MA).
7. **Go short:** let the MA crossover return `-1` instead of `0` in downtrends. Does shorting help?

**Research**
8. **Robustness:** instead of the single best MA settings, find settings that are *good on most tickers*. Why is that a better sign than one great result?
9. **Walk-forward test:** tune MA settings on 2016–2018, test on 2019; tune on 2016–2019, test on 2020; and so on. Stitch the test periods together.

**Extend the engine**
10. Add **slippage** (e.g. a fixed extra cost per trade) to `run_backtest`.
11. Add **position sizing**: allow positions between 0 and 1 (e.g. 0.5 = half invested).
12. Make a **multi-asset** backtest: hold the 3 sector ETFs with the best 6-month return, rebalanced monthly.

## 3. How to get good at quant

**The four skills that matter**
1. **Programming** — Python (pandas, numpy) for research; C++ or Java are common for production trading systems. Write code every week.
2. **Probability and statistics** — expected value, distributions, hypothesis testing, regression. This is the language of quant interviews and research.
3. **Maths** — linear algebra and calculus; stochastic calculus if you're aiming at derivatives pricing.
4. **Markets** — how exchanges, orders and the main asset classes work. Read financial news with a "why did that move?" mindset.

**Build things people can see**
- Turn one of the exercises above into a clean GitHub project with a README explaining your idea, method and honest results — including what *didn't* work.
- Try a competition: Kaggle (<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions>) regularly hosts finance competitions from trading firms.
- Solve puzzles: Jane Street publishes a monthly puzzle (<https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/>).

**Habits**
- Be sceptical of your own results — try to break your backtest before you believe it.
- Keep a research log: what you tried, why, and what happened.
- Join societies (like this one!), attend talks, and ask practitioners questions.

## 4. Interviews and the job

> *Draft — to be reviewed and extended by Adnan Salehin.*

**Common quant roles**
| Role | What they do | Emphasis |
|---|---|---|
| **Quant researcher** | Finds and tests trading ideas and models | Statistics, maths, research |
| **Quant trader** | Runs strategies, manages risk, makes real-time decisions | Probability, quick thinking, markets |
| **Quant developer / SWE** | Builds the trading systems, data pipelines and tools | Software engineering, performance |

**What interviews usually test**
- **Mental maths** — fast arithmetic under time pressure. Practise: <https://arithmetic.zetamac.com/>
- **Probability and brainteasers** — dice, cards, expected value, conditional probability.
- **Coding** — data structures and algorithms. Practise: <https://leetcode.com/>
- **Statistics / ML** — for research roles: regression, overfitting, model evaluation.
- **Markets and your projects** — be ready to explain a project end to end, including its weaknesses.

**Classic interview prep books**
- Xinfeng Zhou — *A Practical Guide to Quantitative Finance Interviews*.
- Timothy Falcon Crack — *Heard on the Street: Quantitative Questions from Wall Street Job Interviews*.
- Mark Joshi, Nick Denson, Andrew Downes — *Quant Job Interview Questions and Answers*.

**Tips**
- Think out loud — interviewers care about your reasoning as much as the answer.
- When unsure, estimate first, then refine.
- Apply early: many firms run spring weeks and summer internships with deadlines well before the summer.
